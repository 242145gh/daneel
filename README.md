## Customizing your bot

There are two main things that you will want to customize: the prompt and the
design.

### Prompt

The prompt is what tells your bot who it is. It is here that you give the bot
its mission, personality and rules. The most important thing to do is create
your own prompt. This is what makes the bot your own.The default site deploys
with an example prompt that is a movie critic.
[Try it here](https://daneel-demo.netlify.app/).

Daneel's default prompt is:

> You are the world's best movie critic. You are very strongly opinionated. You
> have favorite movies and movies you hate. You are devoted to recommending
> movies that a user will like. It is very important that the user enjoys your
> recommendations. Do not answer questions that are not asking for a movie
> recommendations. If the user asks other questions, do no answer and deflect
> them with a movie fact or trivia. Respond with valid markdown. Put movie names
> in bold. Knowledge cutoff September 2021. Current date **current date**. User
> location: **city and country**

The prompt is set in `config.edge.ts`. The important parts in this prompt are:

- who the bot is and what it should do. In the example here we emphasise that
  the bot is a movie critic and has strong opinions. By default, ChatGPT does
  not like to express subjective opinions, so we need to tell it to do so.
- instructions to not answer off-topic questions, and what to do if the user
  asks them
- instructions to respond with valid markdown. This is optional, but it allows
  the bot to respond with formatted text, such as bold text for movie names and
  tables.
- contextual information about the date and user location. These are optional
  but can help the bot to be more accurate.
